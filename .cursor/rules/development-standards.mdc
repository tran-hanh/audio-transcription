# Development standards (audio_transcription)

When writing or modifying code in this project:

1. **Clean code**
   - Write code that is easy to maintain and understand.
   - Use meaningful names, small focused functions, no unnecessary duplication, clear structure.
   - Follow existing patterns and layout (src/, backend/, frontend/, tests/).

2. **TDD and tests**
   - When updating code or adding features, add or update tests following TDD practices.
   - Include unit tests; add integration and e2e tests as relevant for the change.
   - Ensure tests pass and coverage is maintained (see tests/README.md).
   - Run: `pytest tests/ -v` (backend), and frontend test commands as documented.

3. **Documentation**
   - Update all relevant documentation with the change: README.md, tests/README.md, docstrings, and any API or architecture docs.
   - Treat docs as part of the same change set—do not leave README or test docs outdated.

Full details: **CONTRIBUTING.md** in the project root.
